# TITLE
Putative H-NS target genes from H-NS binding sites found in ChIP-chip analysis (from Oshima et al 2006)

# DESCRIPTION
List of genes associated to regions of H-NS binding (flagged as bound by H-NS in the reference, see Supplementary Table 1 for details). The genome-wide distribution of H-NS was investigated by Oshima et al using a high-density oligonucleotide chip (ChIP-chip analysis). The experiment was performed with the strain W3110 of E. coli K12 grown in LB medium. The H-NS genome-wide binding was assesed on exponentially growing cells. The W3110 strain is very similar to the MG1655 strain and in their data analysis the genome coordinates of MG1655 were used (see the "Materials and Methods" section of the reference).
