# TITLE
∆H-NS supercoil sensitive genes (from Blot et al 2006)

# DESCRIPTION
List of genes responding to supercoil changes in a H-NS knockout background. Data from the microarrays by Blot et al, where the wild type level of gene expression is measured (from E. coli K12 cells growing in rich media) relative to genetically engineered E. coli LZ41 and LZ54 strains containing drug-resistant topoisomerase gene alleles to inhibit DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV activity selectively  and thereby inducing negative supercoil relaxation (−σ < 0.033 on average, as measured on plasmids) or increase (−σ > 0.08 on average, as measured on plasmids). In addition, these strains were crossed with the knockout ∆H-NS in order to determine the coupling of the effect of a specific nucleoid protein with a specific level of supercoiling.  Phantom genes have been removed from the list.
