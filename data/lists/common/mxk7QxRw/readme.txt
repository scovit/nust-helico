# TITLE
Putative targets genes of RNA-polymerase during rapid growth from ChIP-chip analysis (from Grainger et al 2005)

# DESCRIPTION
ChIP-chip analysis was used to determine the genome-wide DNA-binding pattern of RNA polymerase in midlog E. coli cells growing in LB medium. Immunoprecipitated DNA samples, prepared from E. coli MG1655 using an antibody against the RNA polymerase subunit and, as a control, from MG1655 delta-crp by using anti-CRP, were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. The samples were combined and hybridized to the microarray, which was then scanned, and Cy5/Cy3 ratios were calculated for each probe. This analysis was conducted after a treatment with rifampicin of 15 minutes (blocking RNA polymerases at functional promoters). Using a  Cy5/Cy3 cut-off of 20 the list of target genes was identified.  The data set contains these putative RNA-polymerase target genes.
