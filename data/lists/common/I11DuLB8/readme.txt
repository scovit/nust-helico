# TITLE
∆H-NS sensitive genes (positive supercoil).

# DESCRIPTION
Genes responding to H-NS knockout in an enhanced positive supercoil background. Data from the microarrays of Blot et al, where the wild type level of gene expression is measured (from E. coli K12 cells growing in rich media) relative to genetically engineered E. coli LZ54 strain containing drug-resistant topoisomerase gene alleles to inhibit topoisomerase IV activity and thereby inducing positive supercoil (−σ > 0.08 on average, as measured on plasmids). In addition, this strain was crossed with the knockout ∆H-NS in order to determine the coupling of the effect of a specific nucleoid protein with a specific level of supercoiling. Phantom genes have been removed from the list.
