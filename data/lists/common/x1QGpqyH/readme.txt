# TITLE
List of mutated genes in E. coli long-term evolution experiment through 40,000 generations

# DESCRIPTION 
The genomes of E. coli clones sampled at generations 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 and 40,000 from an asexual population that evolved with glucose as a limiting nutrient have been sequenced. The complete sequence of the ancestral strain (REL606, GeneBank accession number NC_012967.1) served as a reference to identify mutations in the evolved clones. The data set contains all genes showing a single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the evolved clones through 40,000 generations.
