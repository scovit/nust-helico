# TITle 
FNR binding sites in stationary phase using ChIP-chip (from Grainger et al 2007).

# DESCRIPTION
List of FNR targets from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density microarrays, measuring the binding distribution of the global transcription regulator protein, FNR, across the entire Escherichia coli chromosome in stationary growing cells.  The data set is a list of the putative binding targets relative to thehighest confidence (top 5%) binding sites.
