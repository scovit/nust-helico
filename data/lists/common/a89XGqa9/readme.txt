# TITLE 
Putative target genes of CRP from ChIP-chip analysis (from Grainger et al 2005).

# DESCRIPTION
CRP-binding sites were identified using ChIP-chip analysis, determining the locations of DNA binding sequences of CRP for E. coli MG1655 cells grown in a minimal medium. Mutants carrying a crp or a melR deletion were used to subtract background non-specific binding. After scrutinizing eight independent experiments, the authors identified reproducible and anambiguous peaks corresponding to CRP binding sites and were able to associate the corresponding gene targets (nearly half correspond to sites at promoter previoulsy validated). The list represents these putative CRP target genes.
