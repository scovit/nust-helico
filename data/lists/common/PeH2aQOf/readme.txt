# TITLE
List of E. coli essential genes identified by Baba et al 2006.

# DESCRIPTION
Essential Genes of E. coli K-12, obtained by systematic construction of single gene knock out mutants of all genes/ORFs including putative ones has been performed (Baba et al., 2003) by using Wanner's method (Datsenko and Wanner, PNAS, 2000). Removal of the inducer leads to cell death or growth cessation if the gene is essential under those growth conditions. Mutants were obtained using E. coli K-12 BW25113 as strain background (Keio Collection).
