# TITLE 
FIS binding targets from ChIP-seq (Kahramanoglou et al 2010)

# DESCRIPTION
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), FIS binding sites have been identified in E. coli K-12 MG1655. The experiments have been performed under multiple time-points during growth in rich media. The data set is a list of putative targets from these experiments, over all growth phases. It is composed of the putative binding targets relative to the highest confidence (top 5%) binding sites.
