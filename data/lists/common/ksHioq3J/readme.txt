# TITLE
Putative FIS target genes from ChIP-chip experiments (from Cho et al 2006)

# DESCRIPTION
List of genes associated to a binding site of FIS obtained by high-density ChIP-chip by Cho et al, considering both binding in intergenic regions both binding in ORFs (see reference for details). The experiment is performed using the E. coli strain BOP608 (derived from the MG1655 strain) grown in M9 medium with glucose. The ChIP-chip analysis was performed on exponentially growing cells.
