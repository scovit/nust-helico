# TITLE ∆FIS sensitive genes (negative supercoil or relaxation).

# DESCRIPTION
Genes responding to FIS knockout in an enhanced negative supercoil background. Data set obtained from microarray data by Blot et al., where the wild type level of gene expression is measured (from E. coli K12 cells growing in rich media) relative to genetically engineered E. coli LZ41 containing drug-resistant topoisomerase gene alleles to inhibit DNA gyrase activity and thereby inducing negative supercoil relaxation (−σ < 0.033 on average, as measured on plasmids). In addition, this strain was crossed with the knockout ∆FIS in order to determine the coupling of the effect of a specific nucleoid protein with a specific level of supercoiling. Phantom genes have been removed from the list.
