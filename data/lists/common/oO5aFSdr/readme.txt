FNR binding targets in midlog phase in the presence of oxygen using ChIP-chip (from Grainger et al 2007)

# DESCRIPTION
List of genes affected by FNR binding, from data using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density microarrays, measuring the distribution of the global transcription regulator protein FNR across the entire Escherichia coli chromosome in growing cells. The data set is a list of the putative binding targets relative to the highest confidence (top 5%) binding sites.
