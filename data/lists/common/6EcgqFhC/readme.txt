# TITLE
FIS knockout sensitive genes in the early-exponential growth phase (from Bradley et al 2007)

# DESCRIPTION
The data set includes the genes significantly changing their expression under FIS knockout with respect to the WT in the early-exponential growth phase. In order to gain insight into the global effects of FIS on E. coli gene expression during different stages of growth, DNA microarray analyses were conducted in FIS and wild-type E. coli K12 strains during early-exponential growth phase.
