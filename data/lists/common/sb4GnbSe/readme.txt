# TITLE
Genes whose expression is affected by the carbon source

# DESCRIPTION
List of genes whose expression is strongly affected by the carbon source present in the medium (expression change of least a 2‚Äêfold increase or decrease) obtained from the RegulonDB database 7.2. Genes are classified starting from experimental results in literature. This data set is a subset of the list "Genes whose expression is affected by growth conditions" present in our database.
