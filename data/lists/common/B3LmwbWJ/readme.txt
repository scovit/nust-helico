# TITLE
List of E. coli essential genes identified by Gerdes et al 2003.

# DESCRIPTION
Data for the essential genes in E. coli MG1655 generated by Gerdes and coworkers, using a genetic footprinting technique for a genome-wide assessment of genes required for robust aerobic growth of Escherichia coli in rich media. In their paper the authors compare the essentiality determinations from 3 sources: the PEC database, the Blattner lab systematic Tn5 mutagenesis project, and their own work.
