# TITLE
Conditionally essential genes in rich media (no growth in at least one rich media-based stress)

# DESCRIPTION
Using high-throughput phenotypic analysis of a mutant library in different physiologically relevant stresses and drug challenges, Nichols et al identified conditionally essential (CE) genes, i.e. genes essential for growth in a specific conditions. In particular, the gene-deletion strains that exhibit no growth in at least one rich-media-based stress are classified as rich-media CE. The corresponding genes compose the present list.  Merging this list and the list of "Conditionally essential genes due to auxotrophy" available in the database gives the complete set of CE genes. The entire data set resulting from Nichols et al. experiments is available in an interactive, searchable format and as a flat file on the E. coli wiki website (at http://ecoliwiki.net/tools/chemgen/). In the study the strain BW25113 of E.coli K12 is considered as the wild type and mutants were constructed in BW25113 (Keio Collection strain background), while sRNA and small protein deletions were constructed in MG1655 (see Supplemental Information for more details).
