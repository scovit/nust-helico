# TITLE 
FNR binding targets in mid-log phase using ChIP-chip (from Grainger et al 2007).

# DESCRIPTION
List of FNR targets obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density microarrays data, measuring the distribution of the global transcription regulator protein, FNR, across the entire Escherichia coli chromosome in  growing cells. The data set is a list of the putative binding targets relative to the highest confidence (top 5%) binding sites.
