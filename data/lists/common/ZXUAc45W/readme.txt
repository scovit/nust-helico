# TITLE
Genes overlapping with tsEPODs (transcriptionally silent extended protein occupancy domains), obtained using in vivo protein occupancy display technology (from Vora et al. 2009)

# DESCRIPTION
Using a modified large-scale ChIP analysis measuring generic protein occupancy along the genomes (termed in vivo protein occupancy display, IPOD), Vora et al. identified extended (>1 Kb) protein occupancy domains (EPODs). The EPODs were discovered using cells of the MG1655 E. coli strain under early exponential growth in LB medium. The authors classified the EPODs into two classes: those with high gene expression (heEPODs) and those that are transcriptionally silent (tsEPODs). This data set contains all the genes that overlap with tsEPODs domains.
