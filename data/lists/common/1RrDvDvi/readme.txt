# TITLE
Genes whose removal causes growth phenotypes in response to multiple stresses.

# DESCRIPTION
Using high-throughput phenotypic analysis of a mutant library in different physiologically relevant stresses and drug challenges, Nichols et al.  systematically evaluated the phenotype fitness in different environments. Making use of statistical methods, they identified the responsive genes as genes whose removal causes growth phenotypes in response to the stresses tested. The present list is a selection of the multi-stress responsive genes (showing >30 phenotypes), i.e. genes whose gene-deletion strains show a growth phenotype in diverse stresses and conditions. The entire data set is available in an interactive, searchable format and as a flat file on the E. coli wiki website (at http://ecoliwiki.net/tools/chemgen/ ). In the study, the strain BW25113 of E.coli K12 is considered as the wild type and mutants were constructed in BW25113 (Keio Collection strain background), while sRNA and small protein deletions were constructed in MG1655 (see Supplemental Information for more details).
