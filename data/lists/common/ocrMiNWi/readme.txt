# TITLE 
H-NS binding targets from ChIP-seq (Kahramanoglou et al 2010)

# DESCRIPTION
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), H-NS binding sites have been identified in E. coli K-12 MG1655. The experiments have been performed under multiple time-points during growth in rich media. The data include the putative H-NS targets from the binding peaks. The data set is a list of the putative binding targets relative to the highest confidence (top 5%) binding sites over all growth phases.
