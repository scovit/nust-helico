# TITLE
Putative IHF target genes in mid-log phase from ChIP-chip experiments (from Grainger et al 2006).

# DESCRIPTION
List of target genes for the binding of the nucleoid associated protein IHF across the E. coli genome in vivo, obtained using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-density microarrays (ChIP-chip). Experiments were performed using E. coli strain MG1655 grown to mid-log phase in M9 minimal media supplemented with fructose. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments using antibodies directed against IHF were labelled with Cy5, while a control sample, labelled with Cy3, was generated from an aliquot of the total cross-linked nucleoprotein, reserved before immunoprecipitation. The Cy5-labelled samples were then mixed with the control Cy3-labelled sample and hybridized to the microarray. After washing and scanning, the Cy5/Cy3 signal intensity ratio was calculated for each probe and experiments were done in duplicate. A stringent cut-off was chosen and all probes that had an intensity ratio greater than this value in both experiments were selected as a target. Adjacent target probes were merged, the target position being defined by centre of the probe with the highest average intensity ratio. From the corresponding position of binding sites on the E.coli MG1655 chromosome, the authors identified a list of putative target genes of IHF.
