# TITLE
Putative target genes of H-NS in early-exponential phase from ChIP-seq experiments (from Kahramanoglou et al 2010).

# DESCRIPTION
The binding of H-NS on E. coli chromosome were identified by Kahramanoglou et al with a genome-scale investigation using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). From the chromosomal position of binding sites putative gene targets were obtained with the following procedure: Genes in an operon are considered as targets if at least 50 bp of the intergenic region upstream of the operon overlap with a binding region. For long intergenic regions, only the first 400 bp of the upstream sequence are considered (see Material and Methods of the reference). The E. coli K12 strain used is MG1655. This data set contains putative H-NS target genes during early-exponential growth in LB medium.
