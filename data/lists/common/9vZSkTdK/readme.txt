# TITLE
Conditionally essential genes (essential for growth in a particular media) due to auxotrophy. 

# DESCRIPTION
Using high-throughput phenotypic analysis of a mutant library in different physiologically relevant stresses and drug challenges, Nichols et al identified conditionally essential (CE) genes, i.e. genes essential for growth in a particular conditions. In particular, some gene-deletion strains exhibit no growth in at least one medium due to auxotrophy. The corresponding genes compose the present list. Merging this list and the list of "Conditionally essential genes in rich-media" available in the database gives the complete set of CE genes. The entire data set resulting from Nichols et al. experiments is available in an interactive, searchable format and as a flat file on the E. coli wiki website (at http://ecoliwiki.net/tools/chemgen/). In the study the strain  BW25113 of E.coli K12 is considered as the wild type and mutants were constructed in BW25113 (Keio Collection strain background), while sRNA and small protein deletions were constructed in MG1655 (see Supplemental Information for more details).
